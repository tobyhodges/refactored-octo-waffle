## Rewriting history with Git

While version control is useful to keep track of changes made to a piece of work over
time, it also lets you to modify the timeline of commits. There are several totally
legitimate reasons why you might want to do that, from keeping the commit history clean
of unsuccessful attempts to do something to incorporate work done by someone else.

There are a number of reasons why you may need to change your commit history, for
example:

- You have already made a commit, but realise there are other changes you forgot to
  include
- You made a commit, but then changed your mind and want to remove this change from your
  history
- You want to "move" one or more commits so they are based on top of some other work
  (e.g. new changes made to the `main` branch)

This episode explores some of the commands `git` offers to manipulate the commit history
for your benefit and that of your collaborators. But, first, we will look at another
useful command.

### Set aside your work safely with `stash`

It is not rare that, while you are working on some feature, you need to check something
else in another branch. Very often this is the case when you want to try some
contributor's code as part of a pull request review process (see next episodes). You
can commit the work you are doing, but if it is not in a state ready to be committed,
what would you do? Or you start working on a branch only to realise that it is not the one that you were planning to work on?

`git stash` is the answer. It lets you put your current, uncommitted work aside in a
special state, turning the working directory back to the way it was in the last commit.
Then, you can easily switch branches, pull new ones or do whatever you want. Once you
are ready to go back to work, you can recover the stashed work and continue as if
nothing had happened.

The following are the `git stash` commands needed to make this happen:

Stash the current state of the repository, giving some message to remind yourself what
was this about. The working directory becomes identical to the last commit.

```commands, sh
git stash save "Some informative message"
```

List the stashes available in reverse chronological order (last one stashed goes on
top).

```commands, sh
git stash list
```

Extract the **last stash** of the list, updating the working directory
with its content.

```commands, sh
git stash pop
```

Extract the stash with the given number from the list, updating the working directory
with its content.

```commands, sh
git stash pop stash@{NUMBER}
```

Apply the **last stash** without removing it from the list, so you can apply it to
other branches, if needed.

```commands, sh
git stash apply
```

Apply the given stash without removing it from the list, so you can apply it to
other branches, if needed.

```commands, sh
git stash apply stash@{NUMBER}
```

stash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-stash).

## Practice stashing

Now try using `git stash` with the recipe repository. For example:

- Add some ingredients then stash the changes (do not stage or commit them)
- Modify the instructions and also stash those change

Then have a look at the list of stashes and bring those changes back to the
working directory using `git stash pop` and `git stash apply`, and see how the list of
stashes changes in either case.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Amend

This is the simplest method of rewriting history: it lets you amend the last commit you
made, maybe adding some files you forgot to stage or fixing a typo in the commit message.

After you have made those last minute changes - and `staged` them, if needed - all you
need to do to amend the last commit while keeping the same commit message is:

```commands, sh
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

Or this:

```commands, sh
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
```

if you want to write a new commit message.

Note that this will replace the previous commit with a new one -- the commit hash will
be different -- so this approach must not be used if the commit was already pushed to
the remote repository and shared with collaborators.

> ## Edit commit message with your editor
> 
> If you run `git commit` without either the `--no-edit` or `-m` flags, it will open a
> text editor to allow you to enter a commit message. If you are using the `--amend`
> flag, the text editor will contain the commit message for the commit you are amending.
> 
> You can edit the commit message in your text editor however you like, then, when you
> have finished, save and exit. For longer commit messages, the convention is to provide
> a short, one-line summary on the first line, followed by an empty line, then by a more
> detailed description.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Reset

The next level of complexity rewriting history is `reset`: it lets you redo the last (or
last few) commit(s) you made so you can incorporate more changes, fix an error you have
spotted and that is worth incorporating as part of that commit and not as a separate one
or just improve your commit message. Unlike `git revert`, `git reset` will
retrospectively alter your commit history, so it should **not** be used when you have
already shared work with collaborators.

```commands, sh
git reset --soft HEAD^
```

This resets the staging area to match the most recent commit, but leaves the working
directory unchanged - so no information is lost. Now you can review the files you
modified, make more changes or whatever you like. When you are ready, you stage and
commit your files, as usual. You can go back 2 commits, 3, etc with `HEAD^2`,
`HEAD^3`... but the further you go, the more chances there are to leave commits
without a parent commit. Resulting in a messy (but potentially recoverable) repository,
as information is not lost. You can read about this recovery process in this [blog post in
Medium](https://www.ocpsoft.org/tutorials/git/use-reflog-and-cherry-pick-to-restore-lost-commits/).

A way more dangerous option uses the flag `--hard`. When doing this, you completely
remove the commits up to the specified one, updating the files in the working directory
accordingly. In other words, **any work done since the chosen commit will be completely
erased**.

To undo just the last commit, you can do:

```commands, sh
git reset --hard HEAD^
```

Otherwise, to go back in time to a specific commit, you would do:

```commands, sh
git reset --hard COMMIT_HASH
```

## `reset` vs `revert`

`git revert` was [discussed in the introductory course](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/rse_introductory_git_course/l1-02-committing-history/index.html).

`reset` and `revert` both let you undo things done in the past, but they both have
very different use cases.

- `reset` uses brute force, potentially with destructive consequences, to
  make those changes and is suitable only if the work has not been shared with others
  already. Use it when you want to get rid of recent work you're not happy with and start
  all over again.
- `revert` is more lightweight and surgical, to target specific changes and creating
  new commits to history. Use it when code has already been shared with others or when
  changes are small and clearly isolated.

## Don't mess with the salt

Let's put this into practice! After all the work done in the previous episode adjusting
the amount of salt, you conclude that it was nonsense and you should keep the original
amount. You could obviously just create a new commit with the correct amount of salt, but
that will leave your poor attempts to improve the recipe in the commit history, so you
decide to totally erase them.

## Changing History Can Have Unexpected Consequences

Like with `git commit --amend`, using `git reset` to remove a commit is a bad idea if
you have **already shared** it with other people. If you make a commit and share it on
GitHub or with a colleague by other means then removing that commit from your Git
history will cause inconsistencies that may be difficult to resolve later. We
only recommend this approach for commits that are only in your local working
copy of a repository.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Removing branches once you are done with them is good practice

Over time, you will accumulate lots of branches to implement different features in you
code. It is good practice to remove them once they have fulfil their purpose. You can do
that using the `-D` flag with the `git branch` command:

```commands, sh
git branch -D BRANCH_NAME
```

## Getting rid of the experiment

As we are done with the `experiment` branch, let's delete it to have a cleaner history.

> * 43536f3 Added instruction to enjoy
> * 745fb8b Adding ingredients and instructions
> ```
> 
> Now there is truly no trace of your attempts to change the content of salt!

### Incorporate past commits with `rebase`

Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base
commit. In other words, you take a collection of commits that you have created that
branched off a particular commit and make them appear as if they branched off a
different one.

The most common use case for `git rebase` happens when you are working on your feature
branch (let's say `experiment`) and, in the meantime there have been commits done to the
base branch (for example, `main`). You might want to use in your own work some upstream
changes done by someone else or simply keep the history of the repository linear,
facilitating merging back in the future.

The command is straightforward:

```commands, sh
git rebase NEW_BASE
```

where `NEW_BASE` can be either a commit hash or a branch name we want to use as the new
base.

The following figure illustrates the process where, after rebasing, the two commits of
the feature branch have been recreated after the last commit of the main branch.

![](fig/rebase.png "Rebase process with a feature branch being moved to another branch"){alt='Rebase process with a feature branch being moved to another branch'}

rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase).

## Practice rebasing

We are going to practice rebasing in a simple scenario with the recipe repository.
We need to do some preparatory work first:

- Create a `spicy` branch
- Add some chillies to the list of ingredients and commit the changes
- Switch back to the `main` branch
- Add a final step in the instructions indicating that this should be served cold
- Go back to the `spicy` branch

If you were to add now instructions to chop the chillies finely and put some on top
of the mix, chances are that you will have conflicts later on when merging back to
main. We can merge `main` into `spicy`, as we did in the previous episode, but that
will result in a non-linear history (not a big deal in this case, but things can get
really complicated).

So let's use `git rebase` to bring the `spicy` branch as it it would have been
branched off `main` after indicating that the guacamole needs to be served cold.

> ## Solution
> 
> After the following commands (and modifications to the files) the repository history

> 
> ```commands, sh
> git switch -c spicy
> # add the chillies to ingredients.md
> git stage ingredients.md
> git commit -m "Chillies added to the mix"
> git switch main
> # Indicate that should be served cold in instructions.md
> git stage instructions.md
> git commit -m "Guacamole must be served cold"
> git graph
> ```
> 
> ```output
> * d10e1e9 (HEAD -> main) Guacamole must be served cold
> | * e0350e4 (spicy) Chillies added to the mix
> |/
> * 5344d8f Revert "Added 1/2 onion"

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- There are several ways of rewriting git history, each with specific use cases associated to them
- Rewriting history can have unexpected consequences and you risk losing information permanently
- Reset: You have made a mistake and want to keep the commit history tidy for the benefit of collaborators
- Stash: You want to do something else -- e.g. switch to someone else's branch -- without losing your current work
- Rebase: Someone else has updated the main branch while you've been working and need to bring those changes to your branch
